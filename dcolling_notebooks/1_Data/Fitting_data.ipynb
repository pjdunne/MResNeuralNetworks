The simplest way is to draw a straight line between your data point and then use this to estimate the data between the points that you have. You can write your own linear interpolation algorithm but *scipy* has one built in. Consider the following example: using a spline is a comon approach, with a cubic spline being the most common as it is smooth and double differentaiable."

It will then find a local minimum of this function starting from the initial guess. In that regard, iminuit minimizer is like other local minimizers, like those in scipy.optimize.\n",
