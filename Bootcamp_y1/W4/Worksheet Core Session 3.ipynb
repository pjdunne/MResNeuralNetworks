    "In the previous two lab sessions, all the coding was carried out within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Notebooks are useful when executing small blocks of code for quick analysis, and using them as a record of results is highly recommended. However there will come a time when you are required to write larger blocks of code that become increasingly complicated, making notebooks not as immediately helpful. A common method of handling larger coding projects is through using an Integrated Development Environment, or an IDE. An IDE provides a platform with which to develop and execute code, similar to Jupyter Notebooks. There are however some key differences that make an IDE an attractive way to code.\n",

    "\n",
    "In session 1 we already discussed some basic coding practices. In general you will produce multiple .py scripts throughout your degree that will contain a variety of functions and associated code. With this in mind there are some more general guidelines that should be considered when producing any piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comment Header\n",
    "Despite a descriptive name it can be unclear to know exactly what a file will contain and what it sets out to accomplish. Comments at the beginning of a file (or 'head', hence the name header) that describe the problem will let the reader know what to expect. Including your name (this is your work and should be recognised as such) is also recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Spyder environment we have two locations where code can be entered: the input console and the script environment. The input console is useful for quickly testing some commands to ensure you understand their functionality but is unsuited for any significant code development. It is recommended that you code primarily in the script environment as this is saved to a file and will serve as a record of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming of functions, variables, and loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the work to come below will involve creating functions, variables, arrays and flow control structures and appropriately naming them will improve code legibility. Some physical examples include naming velocity variables **v** or **vel** and an array that holds the x-position of particles **x** or **xpos**. Don't be afraid to be descriptive in your names but also keep them as short as possible. A good practice would be to create a key in the comment header that describes the variables and arrays you have used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layout of code\n",
    "\n",
    "When you move onto developing larger programs, you will begin to develop multiple functions and code blocks. Therefore it is important to have a structure with how this should be laid out to increase visibility. The following structural layout is recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import necessary libraries.\n",
    "- Define any constants.\n",
    "- Define functions that your code will need.\n",
    "- Main body of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grouping of similar objects cuts down on clutter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formally Exiting a Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is not strictly required, it is good practice to formally end your code with the exit or quit command. This makes sure there are no background memory issues."

This is a common occurence that will happen through your coding career as you improve upon and expand written code. However there exists the possibility that while doing this you introduce errors into your code and find yourself in a position where you now have a broken code. Therefore it is advantageous to have a way to roll back your code to its simpler functionality; this is the concept of source control. One simple but effective way of ensuring this, is to simply make a copy of your .py script and stash it somewhere safe before attempting modifications. Therefore if you break your current code beyond repair you can simply delete the file and load the older one. For more sophisticated versions of source control there are programs such as *git* which handle these scenarios. These will not be looked at in this course but the reader is encouraged to look at this at their leisure."
