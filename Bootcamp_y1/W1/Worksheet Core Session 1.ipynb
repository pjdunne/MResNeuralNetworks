You can add more code cells by pressing the 'insert cell below' button (plus symbol). By default any new cells you add are code cells; however you can change these to Markdown  in the drop-down list in the toolbar to allow you to make your own notes in the lab scripts. For a cheat sheet on Markdown, see [here](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html).\n",

However, the core Python programming language does not include many mathematical functions that you might expect to use. So, for example, if you needed to use trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, etc, you would have to write your own code using to implement these. If you wanted to do numerical integration you would have to write the code. If you wanted to display results as plots, you would have to write (quite a lot of) code to do it, and so on. This would be tiresome and very time consuming. Fortunately, there are libraries of code that provide for most of these common requirements, and much more!\n",
