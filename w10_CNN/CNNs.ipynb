    "Kernel convolution is not only used in CNNs, but is also a key element of many other Computer Vision algorithms. In summary it is a process where we take a small matrix of numbers (called kernel or filter), we pass it over our image and transform it based on the values from filter. Subsequent feature map values are calculated according to the following formula, where the input image is denoted by f and our kernel by h.

    "### Translational invariance\n",
    "One important aspect of convolutions is that they're 'translationally invariant'. Since the kernel only ever acts locally on one part of the image, it doesn't care where in the image a particular pattern is located. i.e. If the picture above was shifted 10 pixels to the right, you'd still get the same output, just also shifted 10 pixels to the right. That means if you find a kernel that is good at identifying a particular feature, it will find that feature wherever it is in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It's still a neural network\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are still neural networks so you still have to put an activation function after each layer to make sure the result couldn't just be simplified into a linear transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The output of each layer can be much larger than the one before\n",
    "If you have a single kernel then you end up with a volume the same size as the one you started. However, you can also have several kernels per layer in which case your volume grows by a factor of the number of kernels you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above of our volume, you can see that the second layer has a much bigger depth than the first, and this is exactly because one usually has several kernels per layer. Next we'll look at how to deal with this."

    "## Stopping the growth, stride and pooling <a id='stopping'></a>[^](#index)\n",
    "We began with CNNs to avoid having too many variables in our layers. However, we've noticed that the size of our CNN grows as we add more kernels in each layer. For example, if we use 10 kernels and have 5 layers, the network's size significantly increases by the final layer. Eventually, we need to make our network smaller to match our desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main approaches to achieve this:\n",
    "1. Add a regular 'fully connected' neural network layer at the end of the model.\n",
    "2. Increase the 'stride' value.\n",
    "3. Implement 'pooling'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option presents the same issues we initially tried to avoid, so we'll explore a different approach first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stride\n",
    "Instead of moving your kernel across the image one pixel at a time, you move N pixels at a time. This results in the height and width of your output volume being a factor of N smaller. However, if the stride is too big you could miss features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooling\n",
    "Instead of changing how you do the convolution, pooling takes the output from a layer of the network and processes the volume to reduce its size before passing it onto the next layer. Typically this works by splitting the image up into small blocks or 'pools' and performing a mathematical operation on each pool that results in a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common pooling is 'max pooling' where you just take the largest value in the pool, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cs231n.github.io/assets/cnn/maxpool.jpeg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has the advantage that if your kernel has found a very localised feature, you won't dilute its response to that feature.\n",
