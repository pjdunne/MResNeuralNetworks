    "\n",
    "The code we have looked at so far took a **procedural approach** to programming. In procedural programming, there is a clear distinction between variables (and the data structures that hold them) and the procedures (functions, subroutines, blocks of code) that operate on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Orientated Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, variables and data structures are **bundled together** with procedures into **objects**.  The OOP approach allows a complex programming task to be broken down into self-contained components that can be used by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "All individual objects have three basic characteristics:\n",
    "- **Identity** (i.e. name, this must be unique and distinct)\n",
    "- **State** (describes the current properties of the specific object)\n",
    "- **Behaviour** (refers to actions the object can take)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language fully supports the object-oriented programming **paradigm**. Although it is possible to ignore the object-oriented aspects of Python and treat it as a procedural programming language, practically everything in Python is in fact an object. Data structures and variables are objects. Data types are objects. Imported modules are objects. In Python, even functions are actually objects.\n"

It would be quite wrong to have a class Face that inherited from class Nose because a Face has a Nose rather than is a Nose. This may sound obvious but you would be amazed how often people make this mistake.\n",

Thinking back to the FourVector class, a fourvector has a threevector (r) and a scalar (t or ct). But a fourvector is not a threevector. For example, the length is obtained in a different way and vector operations like the cross-product do not make sense for a fourvector. Similarly for our hypothetical Face class, composition from a nose, eyes, etc., would be appropriate.\n",
