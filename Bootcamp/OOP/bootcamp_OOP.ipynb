    "\n",
    "The code we have looked at so far took a **procedural approach** to programming. In procedural programming, there is a clear distinction between variables (and the data structures that hold them) and the procedures (functions, subroutines, blocks of code) that operate on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Orientated Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, variables and data structures are **bundled together** with procedures into **objects**.  The OOP approach allows a complex programming task to be broken down into self-contained components that can be used by other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "All individual objects have three basic characteristics:\n",
    "- **Identity** (i.e. name, this must be unique and distinct)\n",

    "- **Behaviour** (refers to actions the object can take)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language fully supports the object-oriented programming paradigm. Although it is possible to ignore the object-oriented aspects of Python and treat it as a procedural programming language, practically everything in Python is in fact an object. Data structures and variables are objects. Data types are objects. Imported modules are objects. In Python, even functions are actually objects.\n"

One approach might be for repr() to contain all the code necessary to print every conceivable object and check for the type of each object. It does not take much thought to realise that this approach would become rather inflexible, especially if we wanted to add our own types, such as classes. In fact what happens is that the responsibility of producing its own string representation is delegated to the object. repr() just checks to see if the object has a method called \\__repr__() and calls that to get the string. This concept of delegating the responsibility to implement well defined behaviour to the object itself is a key advantage to the object-oriented approach to programming.

It is useful therefore if attributes of the class that are intended for internal use only marked as such and/or hidden from the user.

If we give an attribute a name of the form _name we are indicating that it is not intended for public use: it can be used from within the methods of the class to implement behaviour, but should not be used outside the class.

    "Inheritance is one of the important features of OOP. It allows you to build a new class (called a derived class) by extending an existing class (called a base class). The derived class automatically contains the methods and attributes of the base class, although these can be overwritten. This generally makes it easier to create and maintain your programs and allows you to utilise the code in a base class in several derived classes. It also means that by changing the code in your base class you change the behaviour of the derived classes in a common way.\n",

It would be quite wrong to have a class Face that inherited from class Nose because a Face has a Nose rather than is a Nose. This may sound obvious but you would be amazed how often people make this mistake.\n",

Thinking back to the FourVector class, a fourvector has a threevector (r) and a scalar (t or ct). But a fourvector is not a threevector. For example, the length is obtained in a different way and vector operations like the cross-product do not make sense for a fourvector. Similarly for our hypothetical Face class, composition from a nose, eyes, etc., would be appropriate.\n",
