    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets surrounding zero or more comma separated literals: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13]\n",
    "names_of_cats = [\"Ginger\", \"Princess\", \"Zorxo the Clawful\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "Lists don't even have to be of the same type:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Mixed_list = [2,\"Python\",16.5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is an allowed list. Moreover lists don't need to contain any elements, they can be initalised as an empty list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Empty_list=[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is particularly useful when you will be adding elements to the list as your code progresses. To add elements you can use the <span style=\"color:blue\">.append</span> method to a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Empty_list.append(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "Tuples behave very similarly to lists, but are immutable (i.e. they cannot be changed). Tuple literals are created by a writing a sequence of items separated by commas, optionally surrounded by parentheses. To get a tuple with only one element, you need to have a comma after the element.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1,2,3\n",
    "my_tuple = (1,2,3)        # equivalent\n",
    "not_a_tuple = 1           # same as: not_a_tuple=1\n",
    "a_tuple = 1,\n",
    "a_tuple = (\"first!\",)     # here the first and only element of the tuple is \"first!\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many aspects of Python are implicit tuples. For instance, the assignment operator = will happily assign tuples of names to tuples of values:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B,C = 1,2,3\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(A,B,C) = (1,2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = 1\n",
    "B = 2\n",
    "C = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour can be easily used to swap the names of data:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B = 1,2\n",
    "A,B = B,A\n",
    "print(A,B)   # prints 2,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "The third most common collection type used in Python is the Dictionary, or dict, which store mappings from keys to values. For every key, there is a value, which can be almost any Python object. Keys are usually strings, but it is possible to use certain other objects as keys. Dictionary literals are written as a comma-separated list of key:value pairs, with a colon separating key from value, surrounded by (curly) braces. Dict items are accessed using the key within square brackets.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student_grades = {\"Simon\": 60, \"Jenny\":68, \"Laura\":112}\n",
    "student_grades[\"Laura\"] = 100 # Change Laura's grade.\n",
    "student_grades[\"Pug\"] = 58    # New student!\n",
    "print(student_grades[\"Jenny\"])\n",
    "68\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### When should you use each data type?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important question to ask yourself when first thinking about a problem is what data structure is the best for you to use? There is no universal answer for us and will really depend on the situation. When to use a dictionary is pretty straightforward, they are used when you want to link one set of values to another. A phonebook which links a person name to their number is a good use of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use a list or tuple can be harder to understand. The key difference between between lists and tuple is that tuples are immutable, i.e once created they cannot be altered. Therefore a sequence of tuples can be used if you don't expect the sequence (or indeed) want them to change. However if you want to add or remove elements from a sequence during your code execution then lists are the data structure to go with.\n",
