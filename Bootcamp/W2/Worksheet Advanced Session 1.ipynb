    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are defined using square brackets surrounding zero or more comma separated literals: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13]\n",
    "names_of_cats = [\"Ginger\", \"Princess\", \"Zorxo the Clawful\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists don't even have to be of the same type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Mixed_list = [2,\"Python\",16.5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is an allowed list. Moreover lists don't need to contain any elements, they can be initalised as an empty list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Empty_list=[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is particularly useful when you will be adding elements to the list as your code progresses. To add elements you can use the <span style=\"color:blue\">.append</span> method to a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Empty_list.append(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "Tuples behave very similarly to lists, but are immutable (i.e. they cannot be changed). Tuple literals are created by a writing a sequence of items separated by commas, optionally surrounded by parentheses. To get a tuple with only one element, you need to have a comma after the element.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = 1,2,3\n",
    "my_tuple = (1,2,3)        # equivalent\n",
    "not_a_tuple = 1           # same as: not_a_tuple=1\n",
    "a_tuple = 1,\n",
    "a_tuple = (\"first!\",)     # here the first and only element of the tuple is \"first!\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many aspects of Python are implicit tuples. For instance, the assignment operator = will happily assign tuples of names to tuples of values:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B,C = 1,2,3\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(A,B,C) = (1,2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is the same as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A = 1\n",
    "B = 2\n",
    "C = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This behaviour can be easily used to swap the names of data:<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A,B = 1,2\n",
    "A,B = B,A\n",
    "print(A,B)   # prints 2,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "The third most common collection type used in Python is the Dictionary, or dict, which store mappings from keys to values. For every key, there is a value, which can be almost any Python object. Keys are usually strings, but it is possible to use certain other objects as keys. Dictionary literals are written as a comma-separated list of key:value pairs, with a colon separating key from value, surrounded by (curly) braces. Dict items are accessed using the key within square brackets.<br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student_grades = {\"Simon\": 60, \"Jenny\":68, \"Laura\":112}\n",
    "student_grades[\"Laura\"] = 100 # Change Laura's grade.\n",
    "student_grades[\"Pug\"] = 58    # New student!\n",
    "print(student_grades[\"Jenny\"])\n",
    "68\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### When should you use each data type?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important question to ask yourself when first thinking about a problem is what data structure is the best for you to use? There is no universal answer for us and will really depend on the situation. When to use a dictionary is pretty straightforward, they are used when you want to link one set of values to another. A phonebook which links a person name to their number is a good use of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use a list or tuple can be harder to understand. The key difference between between lists and tuple is that tuples are immutable, i.e once created they cannot be altered. Therefore a sequence of tuples can be used if you don't expect the sequence (or indeed) want them to change. However if you want to add or remove elements from a sequence during your code execution then lists are the data structure to go with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most physics applications, we will be dealing with 2D, 3D or even higher dimensionality data that we need to operate on. This is best achieved using arrays contained within the numpy module."

The first thing to consider is: What is my data structure type and what do I want it to be? For physicists the most common change will be to go between a list and an array.
