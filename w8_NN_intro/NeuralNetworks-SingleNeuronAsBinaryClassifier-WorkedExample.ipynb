    "Thus far in the course we have covered classical machine learning algorithms, most of which make use of linear combinations of the data fed to them. The scope of what we are able to achieve is widened when we add non-linearity to our algorithms, using activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will discover, neurons in a neural network are arranged in layers. Not unlike in the human brain, a neuron receives signals of varying strength from other neurons, and essentially 'decides' whether this combined received signal is strong enough for the neuron to 'fire', and how strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'decision' element is replicated by the presence of the activation function in our neuron. All contributions from previous neurons to which it is connected are summed, and passed to the activation function, which then influences how strong a signal our neuron outputs, if any at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this non-linear aspect to our neuron, it would simply output a linear combination of the data passed to it by previous neurons, which in turn also simply contain some linear combination of the data passed to them. We would find that the output of our algorithm is nothing but a linear combination of our input data, and we have therefore achieved nothing special. \n",
    "\n",
