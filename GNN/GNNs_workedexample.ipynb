    "So far in our study of neural networks, we have covered two extremes: fully connected neural networks, where every input to a layer is connected to every output, and convolutional neural networks, where only local points contribute to prediction at a given point. Somewhere between using global features and only using local features lies a method applicable to many problems, so long as we can structure the data in a particular way. This method is referred to as **graph neural networks** (**GNNs**). \n",

    "Before we can discuss GNNS, we first need to understand what we mean by graphs. In general, we use graphs to represent and solve problems where the data is composed of objects and relationships between them, both of which can be described in many ways.\n",

For a specific node, the list of nodes directly connected to it is referred to as the **neighbourhood** of the node. We also refer to nodes that you must traverse $k$ edges to reach as being $k$ **hops** away, and the **$k$-hop neighbourhood** denotes the set of these nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a black & white image where we say any pixel in the image is a node. Because the image has a rectangular structure, every node will have links to 4 adjacent nodes (apart from pixels at the edge of the image). Pixels that are not adjacent will not have edges between them. A schematic of a basic graph can be seen below.\n"
