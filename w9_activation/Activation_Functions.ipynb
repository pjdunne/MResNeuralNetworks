    "Another popular activation function that has allowed the training of deeper networks is the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**. This function returns the input for inputs greater than 0, and returns 0 for inputs less than or equal to 0. Despite its simplicity, ReLU has one major benefit compared to sigmoid and tanh: a strong, stable gradient for a large range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this idea, many variations of ReLU have been proposed. We will implement the following three:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LeakyReLU:** In the negative region of the input space, LeakyReLU has the form of a linear function with a small gradient (alpha), rather than just being 0. This non-zero gradient means that gradients can also 'flow' in this part of the input. We'll see what this means later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ELU:** This is similar to the leaky ReLU but replaces the function in the negative input space with an exponential decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swish:** This is the most recently proposed of these activation functions, and is actually the result of a large experiment with the purpose of finding the \"optimal\" activation function. Swish returns the input multiplied by the sigmoid of the input.\n",
    "Compared to the other activation functions, Swish is both smooth and non-monotonic (i.e. Swish's gradient  has a change of sign). Swish is designed to solve a problem called 'dead neurons' which can occur with standard ReLU. We'll see what this is later, but it is a particular problem with deep networks.\n",

Unlike in linear models, the relationship between loss function and the weights and bias is often not direct (there may be many NN layers with activation function in between).\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a very deep neural network with more than 50 layers. Each layer we move back through the network, we will introduce a further term of $\\frac{\\partial \\phi (z )}{\\partial z}$. So to calculate the effects of the weights from the input terms to the first nodes, our equation would have 50 multiples of this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanishing Gradient Problem** \n",
    "\n",
    "If the expectation of this gradient term is considerably smaller than 1, the multiplication effect will mean that $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$ will become extremely close to 0 for any weights far from the output. The weights are updated in proportion to this gradient term, so a gradient close to 0 will mean that these earlier weights barely update as we repeat each iteration. This results in **slow** or **stalled** learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an activation function that will not have a 0 gradient (such as ReLU) will help to resolve this problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploding Gradient**\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite effect is if the expectation of $\\frac{\\partial \\phi (z )}{\\partial z}$ is much greater than one. In this instance, backpropogation will cause $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$ for earlier terms to be extremely large, and thus cause wild fluctuations in weights that make it difficult for the model to train effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you think gradient flow influences choosing a training rate for your network?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feeling of how every activation function influences the gradients, plot a freshly initialized network and measure the gradients for each parameter at the activation function layers of your model (which are these?) for a batch of 256 images:"

While the gradients for the output layer are very large with values up to 0.1, the input layer has the lowest gradient norm across all activation functions with only 1e-5. This is due to its small maximum gradient of 1/4, and finding a suitable learning rate across all layers is not possible in this setup.\n",

We could do a whole extra class on initialisation, but assume for now that the Kaiming initialisation works for all activation functions reasonably well (the Universitet van Amsterdam course has more information on initialisation in lecture 4: https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/tree/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial4)."

    "The tanh shows a more diverse behavior. While for the input layer we see a larger amount of neurons (neuron outputs?) to be close to -1 and 1 (where the gradients are close to zero), the values in the two consecutive layers are closer to zero. This is probably because the input layers look for specific features in the input image, and the consecutive layers combine those together. The activations for the last layer are again more biased to the extreme points because the classification layer can be seen as a weighted average of those values (the gradients push the activations to those extremes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReLU has a strong peak at 0, as we initially expected. The effect of having no gradients for negative values is that the network does not have a Gaussian-like distribution after the linear layers, but a longer tail towards the positive values. The LeakyReLU shows a very similar behavior, whereas ELU follows a more Gaussian-like distribution. The Swish activation seems to lie in between, although it is worth noting that Swish uses significantly higher values than other activation functions (up to 20).\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that all activation functions show slightly different behavior, although obtaining similar performances for our simple network. Thus it is apparent that the selection of the \"optimal\" activation function really depends on many factors, and is not the same for all possible networks."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have reviewed a set of six activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU, and Swish) in neural networks, and discussed how they influence the gradient distribution across layers. Sigmoid tends to fail deep neural networks as the highest gradient it provides is 0.25 leading to vanishing gradients in early layers. All ReLU-based activation functions have performed well and, besides the original ReLU, do not have the issue of dead neurons. When implementing your own neural network, it is recommended to start with a ReLU-based network and select the specific activation function based on the properties of the network."
