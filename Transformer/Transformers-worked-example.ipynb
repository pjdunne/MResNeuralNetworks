    "A common technique used for training transformers is so-called **learning rate warm-up**. This is when the learning rate starts at 0, and is gradually increased to the desired value over the first few iterations. As a result, the initial learning is with much smaller steps rather than starting with large steps. Without this process, it is common for transformer gradients can be very large early on in training, causing poor results. You can read more about this in the literature, e.g. [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03265) on how warm-up improves performance with the Adam optimizer.\n",
