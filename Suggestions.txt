General:
-Adding keywords at the beginning on notebooks
-Make notes on topics along the way??

**David Colling Fitting Data 1.2
-Expand about cost and loss functions if they are not in statistics notebooks

**David Colling ML Basics 2.1
-Agents for reinforcement learning, not really a concept that is expanded upon or introduced (https://uk.mathworks.com/help/reinforcement-learning/ug/create-agents-for-reinforcement-learning.html)
-kNN not really explained and no resources linked to (https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn#:~:text=The%20k%2Dnearest%20neighbors%20algorithm%2C%20also%20known%20as%20KNN%20or,of%20an%20individual%20data%20point.)
-sklearn.preprocessing what this does in a red box
-For polynomial regression, not sure what is being shown here
- Ridge Regularisation
- Lasso Regularisation
- Elastic Net - (somewhere between the two)

**Jarvist
-Week 8 neural network, add in a bit of explanation for why sigmoid and tanh functions are used as activations functions (https://www.baeldung.com/cs/sigmoid-vs-tanh-functions)
-Week 8 Neural Networks assert cell
- Small problem - formatting different from other code
- explain what the weights do, maths relating to loss gradient
- explanation of gradient decent (https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-for-machine-learning/)

**PD
- Visualising CNN, missing explanation for a cell
