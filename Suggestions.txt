General:
-Adding keywords at the beginning on notebooks
-Adding an outline of sections at beginning of each notebook

**David Colling 2.1
-Agents for reinforcement learning, not really a concept that is expanded upon or introduced (https://uk.mathworks.com/help/reinforcement-learning/ug/create-agents-for-reinforcement-learning.html)
-kNN not really explained and no resources linked to (https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn#:~:text=The%20k%2Dnearest%20neighbors%20algorithm%2C%20also%20known%20as%20KNN%20or,of%20an%20individual%20data%20point.)

**Jarvist
-Week 8 neural network, add in a bit of explaination for why sigmoid and tanh functions are used as activations functions (https://www.baeldung.com/cs/sigmoid-vs-tanh-functions)
-Week 8 Neural Networks assert cell
- Small problem - formatting different from other code
- explain what the weights do, maths relating to loss gradient
- explaination of gradient decent (https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-for-machine-learning/)
